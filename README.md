# Constructors

This app is a Word Guess command-line game built using constructor functions.

The game receives user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.
Type "NPM install" in the terminal to start playing.

Players type one letter at a time and the computer tells them if each letter is correct or not.
Only 9 guesses are allowed per game for the player to guess the correct word picked by the computer.

Good Luck!
